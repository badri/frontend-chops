# Hone your frontend chops
A Drupal themer's work involves more than padding divs, juggling with colors, and changing fonts. Also there is lot of dependency of Themer over Developer. The frontend has got a lot of much needed attention these days thanks to mobile devices and increased complexity. Attend this session to get a taste what it is to walk through the swamps of SASS, mines of omega 4 and the dark woods of frontend testing with some grid magic thrown in to streamline the process of theming. You will never theme the same way again, ever!

What is covered in this session:
* issues faced by themer in a Drupal project
* curing Drupal's "Divitis" problem
* How to reduce developer dependency
* fighting frontend complexity
* base themes, especially omega
* frontend testing
